Simply put, agreement and consent to terms of service today are a joke!

But beneath the jokes, lies a deeper problem. Terms of service and Privacy policies govern our rights online. Whether it is a search engine recording our queries and logging our behaviour, a social network hosting and spreading our data, relationships and messages; every service online that deals with users' data has made its users sign terms.

Terms of service are important: our rights depend on them.

<!--aside class="notes">
Unfortunately, too often, by the time the hidden reality of what is in the terms is uncovered, it is already too late.

And so we're kept in a spiral of reactions and scandals every time we discover something new about what the terms of service enabled a service provider to do.

<!--aside class="notes">
Facebook conducted a psychological experiment, voluntarily showing negative comments to some people in order to test if Facebook was powerful enough to depress its own users. When the experiment was uncovered, people were shocked. But it is written in the terms that data can be used for this kind of purposes, among many others.

<!--aside class="notes">
How's it possible that something as important as the terms that govern most of our rights online are so unpopular?

How's it possible that the biggest lie on the web perpetuates itself?

The answer is, the design of consent is fundamentally broken. Here's how:

<h2 id="terms-of-service-privacy-policies-are-too-long-to-read">①<br />Terms of Service &amp; Privacy Policies are Too Long To Read</h2>
<!--aside class="notes">
It is true that some terms of service are desperately long! It is insane that we should have to read pages of terms just to get a rough idea of what's in them.

Moreover, there's no standardisation in terms. So that means that for each service, the user needs to go read the full terms all over again.

Fortunately, more and more services no provide reader friendly summaries, or plain-English versions alongside the full terms. But this is far from enough.

</figure>
<!--aside class="notes">
A study from 2008 from Lorrie Cranor demonstrates that it would take each individual 76 days of work every year to read the applicable privacy policies online. 

This does not even take into account terms of service, but just privacy policies!

You shouldn't have to be a full time lawyer to have a basic idea about your rights online.

So, what happens next time you think about the problem of terms of service? How are you going to spend your 40 minutes of reading every day, comfortably sitting on your sofa?

Here's your choice: Apple's iTunes terms of service or William Shakespeare's Hamlet.

My advice: Hamlet is shorter.

A lot of services have changed their terms of service for the worse. 

Instagram completely changed its terms to ask for a broad, nearly unlimited copyright license on users' photos --- after Facebook acquired them.

Twitter also changed their copyright license in 2009 to something nearly unlimited. Often, they include the right to grant sublicenses or to transfer the license, without limitation for what's necessary to provide the service.

<h2 id="enforcing-your-rights-in-courts">Enforcing your rights in courts</h2>
<!--aside class="notes">
Some of you might probably say that some of the provisions I have shown you could be strike down in courts. Maybe.

But first:

 1. Having to go to litigation is already a failure. Harm has been done.
    Contracts should ease relationships instead of being fundamentally broken
    in a way that a party always has to go to courts.

 2. This is a global problem. Courts in different jurisdictions under different
    laws may come to different conclusions regarding these practices,
    especially about whether changing terms without notifying users is
    acceptable or not.

 3. And sometimes, even when companies have been fined for practices that have
    been considered illegal, they have still succeeded in profiting from their
    actions.

<p>The Court of Santa Barbara in California is the only one competent for disputes arising from the terms of service of Youtube. The applicable law to these terms of service is the one of the State of California.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>“You and Netflix agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Netflix service, including our website, user interfaces, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Netflix are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Netflix membership. YOU AND NETFLIX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.”</small></p>

ToS;DR is a community of people who share their review of terms. So when one persons reads the terms of one service, other people benefit.

Then, we codify that review and we design it in a way that gives the most important information first.
