The [heartbleed] vulnerability is not only a catastrophic security
issue, [[!toggle id="hearbleedtopics" text="it also spans other
interesting topics."]]

The first obvious lesson, is that the communication around the
vulnerability was [brilliant marketing]. 

The other lesson, less satisfying, is why is the majority of the
internet relying on a very poorly funded project?!

The Washington Post published an [article that misses the real
issue][washpostart]. The heartbleed debacle is not an issue with
the fact that [OpenSSL is Free Software][samssl] (the Apple goto
fail bug shows it’s even worse when it’s proprietary--all Apple
users had to wait several days before a patch was sent), nor with
the fact that the Internet have no single authority (if anything,
the openssl library is a single point of failure).

I find it astonishing that OpenSSL is so poorly funded and
apparently lacks a governance strategy that includes large
stakeholders such as the major websites making use of the library
and which, instead, are essentially all irresponsible free-riders.

The real issue here is one of responsibility.
