I just came back from the cinema, where I watched Spike Jonze’s
*Her*. This movie has got me thinking. 

One thing I notice which was funny is how Theodore’s job kind of
makes him fit the same role that *her*, the AI, is doing for him.
Let me explain a little bit. Theodore, the main character, works
at *beautiful-handwritten-letters.com* a service where people ask
him to write beautiful letters to their wife for their 50th
wedding anniversary, or to their son for his diploma, etc. You get
it. By writing letters for other people, expressing some of their
most *personal* emotions for them or even, instead of them, he
participates to this society where *the human self* dissolves. 

I guess what I’m saying isn’t making sense if you haven’t seen the
movie. So go see it! There aren’t movies like this every year!
