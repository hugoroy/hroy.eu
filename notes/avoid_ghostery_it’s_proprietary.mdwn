I was reading an article by [[!toggle id="lcranor" text="Lorrie
Cranor"]] on the MIT technology Review on [how it’s difficult even
for her to protect her privacy online](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/526421/self-defense/).

I appreciate Lorrie Cranor’s work on privacy at Carnegie Mellon
University. I have extensively cited her study of the length of privacy
policies when I’m introducint ToS;DR.

However in this article, I was disappointed to see Ghostery
mentioned. Ghostery is an browser extension supposed to help users
against tracking and surveillance on the web. The main problem is
that Ghostery is not released as Free Software[^akaos]

[^akaos]: a.k.a Open Source. Both these terms designate the same
set of programs.

[[!toggle id="ghosterycode" text="Earlier on Twitter"]] I
quickly posted my frustration about this. People who promote web
privacy should stop promoting Ghostery, as it’s proprietary.
What’s their business model exactly? ;-)

[[[!toggleable id="ghosterycode" text="""
In [my earlier
tweet](https://twitter.com/hugoroyd/status/459618738091085824) I
wrongly stated that the source code was not disclosed; but that’s
not accurate. There is some code disclosed (I suppose it’s
entirely readable and not obfuscated and minified). But as you’ll
notice, the license is “All rights reserved” so, basically, users
have no rights.

Ghostery has been playing on the ambiguity for too long. This
hypocrisy must stop. [[!toggle id="ghosttweet" text="See these
