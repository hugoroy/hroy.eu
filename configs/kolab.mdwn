Since March 2014, the kolab server is a debian machine. Trying out
CentOS was interesting, but now that the debian packages are good,
I went back to debian, which I know better.

# Syncing: ActiveSync and DAV

I found that ActiveSync did not work very reliably for me. So I
switched to using DAV with [DAVDroid on Android][davdroid]. It’s
less buggy.

For me right now the main problem is that I can’t [sync with Emacs’
org-caldav](http://sjoberg.fi/blog/mykolab-org-mode.html), and I cannot access the webDAV with nautilus.

# Postfix and SMTP

For Kolab 3.3 first install attempt, I did not select a configuration for
postfix, and during setup-kolab, I entered the FQDN instead of the primary
domain name. I ended up with a weird SMTP error 454.

So I retried, this time selecting postfix's default configuration (something
like “Internet site”) and using the primary domain (the default option) instead
of the FQDN during the setup-kolab.
