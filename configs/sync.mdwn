[Sync][Firefox Sync] enables to have Firefox on several devices and to sync
bookmarks, passwords, history, and other browser data between
them.

[Firefox Sync]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Sync

 * followed the instructions provided at
   <http://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-sync.html>
   <!--([cache](run-sync.html))-->
    
    On CentOS 6, you need to install these packages:
    <code>mercurial python python-devel python-virtualenv
    sqlite-devel openssl-devel make gcc</code>


 * sqluri changed <code>sqlite:///tmp/</code> to
   <code>sqlite:///home/hrd/Sync/</code>

 * Adjusted the per-user quota to <code>quota_size = 51200</code>
  
    (this should be more than enough, even for I who have not
    emptied my browser history for years)

 * I added this in <code>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</code>:
        
        -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT

    and restarted iptables.

 * Sync server available and running from
   <https://totosh.ampoliros.net:5000/>

The last parameter is the only one you need to know if you use
to wish my Sync server instead of Mozillaâ€™s. But let me warn
you: this is really for personal purposes, so please set
yourself elsewhere, it's good and [easy to set up!](/posts/setup_mozilla-sync)
