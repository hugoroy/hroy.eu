[[!meta title="Submit prior art to the European Patent Office"]]

[[!tag lang:en patents EPO]]

The European Patent Convention allows any person to submit prior art at
the European Patent Office. There are two procedures:
[one](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ar115.html)
before the patent is granted (the “observations” procedure), the
[other](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/apv.html)
within 9 months after the patent is granted (the “opposition”
procedure).

The official languages of the European Patent Office are English, French
and German. You should provide translations to one of these languages
for documents in other languages.

0. Which prior art references can you submit?
=============================================

Two conditions are absolutely necessary for a document to constitute
prior art:

-   the document must have been made available to the public

-   the publication date is paramount in order for prior art to be
    relevant for challenging patent validity, so any document where the
    publication date is uncertain is going to have less value.[^1]

In order to constitute prior art and establish that the patent
application claims something that is **not new**, the publication date
must precede the patent application filing date and its priority date.

1. The EPO observation procedure
================================

The observation procedure starts after the publication of the European
patent application (according to article
[93](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ar93.html))
and ends when such application is granted. The EPO
[guidelines](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/guidelines/e/e_v_3.htm)
specify that:

> Although lack of novelty and/or inventive step are the most common
> observations, third-party observations may also be directed to clarity
> (Art. 84), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83), patentability (Art.
> 52(2) and (3), 53 or 57) and unallowable amendments (Art. 76(1),
> 123(2)).

Third-party observations can be [submitted online directly to the
EPO](http://www.epo.org/searching/free/observations.html).

2. The EPO opposition procedure
===============================

The opposition procedure is much more complex. A third-party filing a
notice of opposition will become a party to the procedure.

Any person may oppose a patent **within 9 months of the publication of
the mention of the grant** in the European Patent
[Bulletin](http://www.epo.org/searching/free/bulletin.html). The
formalities of the opposition notice are set forth in rule
[76](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/r76.html).

> (a) particulars of the opponent as provided in [Rule
>     41](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/r41.html),
>     paragraph 2(c);
>
> (b) the number of the European patent against which opposition is
>     filed, the name of the proprietor of the patent and the title of
>     the invention;
>
> (c) a statement of the extent to which the European patent is opposed
>     and of the grounds on which the opposition is based, as well as an
>     indication of the facts and evidence presented in support of these
>     grounds; […]
>
* * * * *

The procedure is not admitted until the fees are paid:

> […] Each party to the opposition proceedings shall bear the costs it
> has incurred, unless the Opposition Division, for reasons of equity,
> orders, in accordance with the Implementing Regulations, a different
> apportionment of costs. […] (article
> [104](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ar104.html)).

These rules are set forth in rule
[88](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/r88.html).

> (1) The apportionment of costs shall be dealt with in the decision on
>     the opposition. Such apportionment shall only take into
>     consideration the expenses necessary to assure proper protection
>     of the rights involved. The costs shall include the remuneration
>     of the representatives of the parties.
>
> (2) The Opposition Division shall, on request, fix the amount of costs
>     to be paid under a final decision apportioning them. A bill of
>     costs, with supporting evidence, shall be attached to the request.
>     Costs may be fixed once their credibility is established.

Oppositions may be [submitted
online](http://www.epo.org/applying/european/oppositions.html).

Find relevant patent and patent applications
============================================

You can [search through the EPO’s patent
database](https://register.epo.org/regviewer). You can also search
through the
[classification](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/classification) to find
relevant classes.

[^1]: Where the actual publication date of a document is not known, you
    will have to provide evidence to establish when the document was
    publicly available.
