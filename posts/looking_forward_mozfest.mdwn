I just had a good day ☺ 

The results of the first part of the [bar
exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_examination#France) were
announced earlier today. I passed! So I’ve got no more excuses
now: I’ve got to work to pass the second part (oral exams). Of
course, that's kind of a relief because with these kinds of exams
you're never really sure if you succeeded. 

To make things even better today, it looks like Kolab on Debian is
going to get some love from the Free Software community!

 - Kolab now has [nightly builds for both CentOS and
   Debian](https://kolab.org/blog/timotheus-pokorra/2013/10/23/nightly-builds-kolab-centos-and-debian)

 - Torsten published a [Call for
   Participation](https://kolab.org/blog/grote/2013/10/23/call-participation)
   explaining some of the reasons why Kolab on Debian does not
   benefit from the same level of involvement than Kolab on
   CentOS.

 - So now, it's our job as a community to take care of it and make
   sure that Kolab becomes a first-class citizen on Debian! If you have
   some experience in packaging: please go read
   [HowTo improve Debian packages using OBS](https://kolab.org/blog/timotheus-pokorra/2013/10/24/howto-improve-debian-packages-using-obs)

 - It seems like Paul is [already looking into helping!](http://blogs.fsfe.org/pboddie/?p=455)

As far as I'm concerned, this is all great news. It is a bit sad
that I was too impatient and already went for [CentOS to try
Kolab](/posts/kolab_up/). But at least now, I know I can recommend
Kolab to my friends who use Debian: the community is here to
help! I'll have to find a way to contribute personally though ☺ 

Oh and BTW, I'm now in London until Monday. Mozilla invited me to
run [a session at the Mozilla
festival](http://sessions.mozillafestival.org/proposals/fighting-the-biggest-lie-on-the-web-i-have-read-and-agree-to-the-terms-of-service/)
on “Fighting the biggest lie on the Web” (I agree to the terms of
service!)

I am really looking forward to this. Mozilla is one of the most
important organisation building the technologies that empower
people! I don't even want to think about what the web would look
like today without the work they have done (including a lot of
volunteers and a [very open way](http://paulrouget.com/e/openness/)).
I can't wait to feel the atmosphere of the festival!

So if you're in London too, even if you're not attending #MozFest 
(I have read the event is already full!) do not hesitate
to get in touch. Tomorrow I'll try to meet with my friend
[Andreas](http://sny.no/ato) who's been a volunteer with the Free
Software Foundation Europe for a long time, and who's moving in
London. I'll also try to catch up with Mark Lizar
who's one of the core persons behind Open Notice, the place where
projects related to ToS and privacy policies collaborate.

Exciting week-end ahead!
