I know I haven’t started writing yet, I’m already worried about
technical issues. How can I handle writing in different languages here?
I’ve seen the [po plugin](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/po/) but it
requires me to set a “Master language” for the whole system. Rather, I
want to be able to set different master languages for each post.[^1]
Because sometimes I start writing in French, some other times I start
writing in English. Most of the time I don’t translate myselft. So
translation isn’t really what I’m looking for.

If you’ve got any suggestion on how to solve this, you’re very welcome.
Until then, I’ll just stick to tagging.

[[!tag lang:en Ikiwiki]][[!meta language="en"]]

[^1]: You might wonder: what for? I’d like to add a
    <code>lang="en|fr"</code> attribute for each post, that would allow
    me for instance to enable hyphenation at line-breaks.
