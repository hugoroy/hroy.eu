This month, French Data Network and La Quadrature du Net filed a
lawsuit to the Conseil d'État, one of the supreme courts, against the
French government on website blocking.

#### Who?

French Data Network, the Fédération FDN and La Quadrature du Net. This
is the same team working against
[[overviewChallengeAgainstDataRetention|Data_Retention]].

#### How?

Right after the [Charlie Hebdo shootings], the French government
issued a *décret* enabling a section of the police to request that
Internet access providers block access to a secret list of websites.

This décret is an application of two laws:

- the 2011 LOPPSI law which had a provision about website blocking in
  order to fight against child pornography
- the 2013 “Cazeneuve law” against terrorism which created a new
  article in the French penal code about “incitement to terrorism” or
  terrorism apology.

For us, the judicial guarantees of our freedoms of expression and of
 communication are at stake!

#### What?

There are several arguments, but in a nutshell:

 - the décret is nothing but clear in limiting the scope of what the
   police can put on that secret list of websites that Internet access
   providers have to block; it could be anything from a whole domain
   name (regardless of the protocols: email, web, whatever) to a
   specific URL.

    This is problematic for two reason: 1) this is an example of the
    autonomy **left to the police to make arbitrary decisions**, without
    judicial oversight and 2) depending on what the police asks, the
    consequences can be very, very different. For instance: domain
    name blocking intercepts too much and has too much **collateral
    censorship**; while URL blocking requires **very intrusive** analysis of
    network connections, i.e. what people are doing online.

 - the décret specifies that ISP must redirect intercepted connections
   to blocked addresses to a server of the Government. This is a
   technical equivalent of denunciation and puts a risk on all of us:
   you never know whether you are going to access a blocked website
   until after you end up on the Government's server. So you better
   not try to inform yourself on sensitive issues... *The government
   has your back (and is behind your back!)*

#### What next?

I'll keep you posted on the blog about the
[[!taglink procedure|décretBlocage]]. It should  take at minimum a year,
if nothing unexpected happens (but it can be significantly longer
depending on prejudicial and accessory procedures...).
