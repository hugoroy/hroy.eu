Grr. I just spent some time setting up a new debian machine to
serve as a new personal and self hosted server. So I started with
trying out kolab.

I followed the instructions in [the official
doc](http://docs.kolab.org/fr-FR/Kolab_Groupware/3.0/html/Community_Installation_Guide/chap-Community_Installation_Guide-Configuration.html) and then run 

    setup-kolab

Unfortunately, it didn't work. When accessing the Kolab web admin
interface, I had no way to add users. Then I figured out that I
could not connect as root to mysql even though I had just set up a
root account for mysql during the setup-kolab process. After
trying out with the former mysql password, I discovered the
database was there properly. But still, the Kolab web admin
wouldn’t let me add users as if there was a problem and indeed
the Roundcube panel was giving a nice 

> DATABASE ERROR: CONNECTION FAILED!

At this point I thought I could try running setup-kolab again to
see what could get wrong. I can't even get to the end of it, now I
get…

Yes. Quite annoying.
