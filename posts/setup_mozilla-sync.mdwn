[Sync][Firefox Sync] enables to have Firefox on several devices and to sync
bookmarks, passwords, history, and other browser data between
them.

[Firefox Sync]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Sync

By default, Firefox Sync will use Mozilla's servers. (Hence, you
have to agree to their Privacy Policy and to their Terms, I hope
[you’ve read them](https://tosdr.org/#mozilla), right?)

There's nothing wrong with Mozilla, they're big champion of Free
Software. But on the one hand, there's definitely something
troubling with sending very private data such as browsing history
over the internet.  Fortunately, Sync encrypts locally before
uploading data and I hope they’re up to the Free Software
standards of [crypto](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Crypto). 

On the other hand, centralisation is often a problem (don't put
all your eggs in the same basket!). First, it puts the burden of
maintaining huge Sync servers on Mozilla whereas a lot of users
could be running Sync themselves and thus do a favour to Mozilla.
Second, Mozilla becomes a single point of failure in case
something's wrong with Sync; and with all the crazy stuff NSA’s
been doing lately avoiding single points of failure is good
because it raises the costs of surveillance.

And really, it is so simple to set up, that you really wonder why
you haven't done it before!

[I’m starting yet another folder on this blog/wiki where I'm going
to post some of the [configs] for my home servers.]
