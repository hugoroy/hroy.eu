This is my first post.

I’ve been thinking about using ikiwiki for some time now. I don’t exactly know what I’ll do here, but I suspect I’m moving away from wordpress-powered <http://blog.hugoroy.eu>. The main reason is that I’m fed up of using the wordpress admin interface when all I want is to publish something I’ve written on my machine.

And git history.
