# *Not* patent facts

Unfortunately, a lot of debates on patents do not rely on facts, especially debates on patents applied to information technology. Instead, we are witnessing what Mark Lemley has described as [“Faith-Based Intellectual Property”](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2587297). Here's a list of things which are **not facts about patents** but which are often asserted.

  - “companies invest  heavily  in software research  and  development  in
    the  United  States  *because* new inventions, implemented through software,
    can be protected by patents”. Yet, the article that makes this assertion
    offers **absolutely no evidence** that the eligibility of software as
    patent subject matter has specifically contributed significantly to US
    growth in software research and development. 

    (I would also note that the conclusion in the executive summary is legally
    incorrect: the promotion of progress in the useful arts is not a
    “constitutional imperative”; under the US constitution, Congress “shall
    *have the power to*“ promote the progress in the useful arts, but this is
    not *an imperative*.)
