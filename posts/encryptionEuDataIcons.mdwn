<h1 class="title">The Privacy Icon which is a bad idea</h1>
</div>
<p>As I've been working on Terms of Service; Didn't Read for a couple of years now, I have some experience and idea about how this sort of things might work and how it compare to existing projects, especially in the fields of “Privacy Icons” where several projects coexist and keep raising much attention (including, it seems, from European legislators).</p>
<p>First, some context for those who haven't followed (feel free to skip to the second part if you've followed personal data regulations updates in the EU). In January 2012, the European Commission <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-46_en.htm?locale=en">announced</a> a plan to revise data protection laws in the European Union with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">draft regulation</a>. Currently, most of the European Union's laws on the protection of personal data come from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive">1995 European Union directive</a>. (Unlike a directive, a <em>EU regulation</em> is law that applies EU-wide without the need for each state to make their own internal legal implementation.)</p>
<p>So, this is going to be 20 years old soon. It's quite extraordinary that even now, the directive does not seem too far off. The intentions are good and it's a great thing that legislators foresaw the need to enhance people's privacy back then (France and Germany already had a law for that by the end of the 1970s). But today, all this is in the middle of <a href="http://www.janalbrecht.eu/themen/datenschutz-und-netzpolitik/lobbyism-and-the-eu-data-protection-reform.html">a huge battle</a>.</p>
<p>After several steps through the European Union's lawmaking process, the regulation is now in a <a href="DPRConsolidated.pdf">consolidated draft</a>.</p>
<p>I want to focus on [[!toggle id=&quot;13a&quot; text=&quot;article 13a (in Chapter Ⅲ, Section 1: Transparency and modalities)&quot;]].</p>

<h1 id="why-the-encryption-icon-is-a-bad-idea">Why the “Encryption” icon is a bad idea?</h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Storing sensitive data in data centers without encrypting them first is just negligence and should not be allowed. There's no need for an icon that probably a large majority of users will not really understand.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the draft proposal, when personal data is collected, the person who's subject of that data should get information in the form of a standardised icon. One of the icons proposed is about encryption:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="iconEncrypt.png" alt="Everything is Safe!" /><p class="caption">Everything is Safe!</p>
</div>
<p>If the data is stored encrypted, then the data controller can display a huge green mark next to the icon. <em>All is fine!</em></p>
<p>Except that it's not. I can really see how this could get very, very confusing. It is very easy to claim that something “is encrypted” and that thus, <em>everything's good.</em></p>
<p>Let's put this in context.</p>
<p>Following Edward Snowden's revelations, it is very clear that encryption is one part of the solution against the intrusion in our lives that the NSA and other State agencies in the world are pursuing. Thus, it is crucial that users understand that <strong>there are ways to protect their communications against the intrusion of the State</strong>, and also from companies or criminals. This is why initiatives such as Cryptoparties and Privacy Cafés or the like, where people help each other understand and use encryption techniques are so important!</p>
<p>But encryption does not always mean the same thing in all contexts. It requires basic technological understanding to grasp when encryption is simply a security good practice against criminals, and when encryption is actually a much more powerful tool.</p>
<p>For instance, when I send sensitive information over the web (like a financial transaction, or like my user nick and password), it is very important that the connection is encrypted (using HTTPS); otherwise, it would not be difficult to intercept that sensitive information. Enabling encryption for that kind of stuff should simply be mandatory.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to impose security obligations over storing personal data. But I fail to see how showing an icon to users about storing data in encrypted form will do any good. Worse, it might even confuse people about what encryption really means, thus making it even harder to explain why encryption is important and why tools such as GnuPG should be improved in usability.</p>
<h1 id="is-this-standardised-icon-set-really-a-good-idea-anyway">Is this standardised icon set really a good idea anyway?</h1>
<p>Raising awareness about privacy rights online is important. This is what I have been doing with <a href="https://tosdr.org">Terms of Service; Didn't Read</a> for about two years now. I've seen several variations of the Privacy Icons idea, and this implementation as suggested by the EU draft regulation shows that it's important to get it right.</p>
<p>The <a href="DPRConsolidated.pdf">consolidated draft</a> has an annex showing how the icons could be:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="dataCollect.png" alt="No unnecessary data collection" /><p class="caption">No unnecessary data collection</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on whether that's the case, the data controller would have to display a green or a red mark next to this icon:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="goodOrBad.png" alt="Good or Bad?" /><p class="caption">Good or Bad?</p>
</div>
<p>In <a href="https://tosdr.org">ToS;DR</a>, we also use this approach: for each point, there's an iconic indication whether this is a good or a bad thing. Only, we allow for more variations:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="ToSDRTitles.png" alt="Good points, and bad points" /><p class="caption">Good points, and bad points</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="thumbsDown.png" alt="… and blockers" /><p class="caption">… and blockers</p>
</div>
<p>But the major problem that I have with “Privacy Icons” is that they are too difficult to grasp. If you actually remove the text aside the icon itself, you realise that the icon itself is far from self-explanatory. This gets even more complex with the number of icons you add.</p>
<p>These icons are not universally understood. Here's how the same concept is rendered differently by different Privacy icons set:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="dataProcessing.png" alt="EU draft" /><p class="caption">EU draft</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="figure">
<img src="dataForPurpose.png" alt="Mozilla&#39;s Alpha version of Privacy Icons" /><p class="caption">Mozilla's Alpha version of Privacy Icons</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="figure">
<img src="dataNoPurpose.png" alt="Mozilla&#39;s Alpha version of Privacy Icons" /><p class="caption">Mozilla's Alpha version of Privacy Icons</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="DisconnectIcons.png" alt="Disconnect.me icons" /><p class="caption">Disconnect.me icons</p>
</div>
<p>Compare these with how a similar point would be addressed in <a href="https://tosdr.org">ToS;DR</a>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="ToSDRTitle.png" alt="The summary version" /><p class="caption">The summary version</p>
</div>
<p>which can be expanded with a plain-English paragraph and links to contextualise if the user wants more information:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="ToSDRParagraph.png" alt="The plain english version" /><p class="caption">The plain english version</p>
</div>
<p>There's probably a way somewhere to learn from these different approaches and make an implementation that gets it right for users.</p>
<p>The EU already made such a thing possible with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_energy_label">energy efficiency labels</a>. (They actually were a source of inspiration for ToS;DR <a href="https://tosdr.org/classification.html">classes</a>.)</p>
<p>Let's hope the next proposal gets it right with an icon system that is more easy to understand and which gets rid of the confusing ones. But an icon system is not an acceptable alternative to making strong regulations that really achieve what it promises: safeguarding what can be saved of our privacy rights in the 21st century.</p>
