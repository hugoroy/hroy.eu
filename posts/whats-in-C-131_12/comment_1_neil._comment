Dear Hugo

I hope that you are well? It has been a long time now - unfortunately, I could
not make the FSFE meeting in Barcelona  this year :(

I just wanted to follow up on our conversation on Twitter about "the right to
be forgotten" - 160 characters is just not enough some times!

The point I was attempting to make is that so much of the reporting about this
issue is describing it as a "right to be forgotten", rather than a right to
object to processing of personal data.

Whilst the CJEU set out some preconditions for the exercise of this right, my
point in terms of liability is that this "right to object" is a right granted
to data subjects and that, conversely, there is no "right to process" granted
to data controllers. Instead, controllers are permitted to process provided
that they satisfy certain criteria, including rules around lawfulness and
legitimacy.

If a controller does not comply with these requirements, they can be sued; the
directive provides that member states must provide for a right of action for a
person who has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful processing operation
to be entitled to receive compensation.

To my mind, this sets the incentives up incorrectly:

- a controller must satisfy certain grounds to be permitted to process
personal data
- if the controller does not meet these requirements, it can be sued by a
data subject
- a data subject has a right to object, which entails providing a "justified
objection" on "compelling legitimate grounds"
- it is left to the data controller to determine whether the complaint meets
these criteria
- even if the controller decides that the criteria are not met, it may have
to defend its decision in court
- if the court upholds the claim, it is unlikely to benefit — spending money
to defend its position when, arguably, there is unlikely to be much of a
business benefit in doing so. Only the biggest, richest companies are likely
to be able to afford to litigate on a point of principle like this
- if the court says that the subject's objection was valid, a damages action
is available

To me, this is a case of the incentives being set incorrectly; if the aim of
the legislation is to ensure a balancing act between the right of privacy and
the right to communication, setting up a structure whereby the controller
could be liable for damages if it fails to remove something following an
objection, only encourages removal.

This is much like the liability protections within the eCommerce directive: an
intermediary is shieled from liability, as long as it removes infringing
material expeditiously. In theory, it is open to the intermediary to argue
that the material is not infringing, and thus it has no liability, but the
incentive is set incorrectly: if a hosting provider is liable unless it
removes the information, it is more than likely to err on the side of removal.


So, a few more than 160 characters, but that's what I was trying to say!


All the best,

Neil
