Hi Neil,

Always interesting to read your thoughts!

I couldn’t make it either. It does seem to be a very long
time!

Yes! You need to use some more space and then link that back to
Twitter ☺

I use this to get this done and I’m quite happy with it:

Yes. I am not happy at all with the characterisation of the
judgment the media’s making either. At the same time, the issue is
quite complex…

We entirely agree on that.



What makes me sad is that is the collateral damage made by this
decision, the right of the public to access lawfully published
information, which IMHO should be considered a part of freedom of
expression because it’s pointless to have the write to express
yourself if other do not have the right to access your thoughts.


I have been quite annoyed by the decision, specifically when it
says:

    The rights to privacy of the data subject override “as a rule,
    not only the economic interest of the operator of the search
    engine but also the interest of the general public in finding
    that information upon a search relating to the data subject’s
    name.” (¶ 97)

especially because article 7 provides a basis for giving
legitimacy to processing based on the rights of the public:

    ‘Member States shall provide that personal data may be
    processed only if:

    …

    (f)      processing is necessary for the purposes of the
    legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the
    third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed,
    except where such interests are overridden by the
    interests [or] fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
    subject which require protection under Article 1(1).’

It seems quite bold to me for the ECJ to basically say that in the
case of personal data being processed, the interests pursued by
the public to access lawfully published information is generally
not legitimate!

Also it’s quite new to me that fundamental rights and freedoms of
individual protected under Article 1(1) do not necessarily need to
demonstrate prejudice. From the theory of subjective rights from
which the right for the respect of private life (which is not the
same as a right for privacy), this is quite interesting.

I’m in favour of better understanding and protection for privacy,
in addition to individuals’ rights to the respect of private life.
But for me, these are two different things. While privacy is
something more social, the right for the respect of private life
is an individual’s subjective right and needs to demonstrate
prejudice.

This decision gives to the data subject an all too important power
in the name of better privacy. I don’t think this decision was the
best way to start this, and I think it did it in a way that cause
more problems than it actually solves.

Now the French CNIL is not happy with Google noticing the media
when they alter search results pointing to their article. But the
fact that it’s a problem is evidence for me that this is all badly
conceived by the ECJ.

Which is worrisome considered the increasing role this court plays
regarding fundamental rights and freedoms...


(By the way, I think this discussion could also be very
interesting in public so that other people can correct me when I’m
wrong and discuss)
