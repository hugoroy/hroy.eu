If you've been wondering why I haven't blogged lately, or why I
haven't replied to your email yet, it's because I have been quite busy
so far for this new year.

Besides starting at a law firm in Paris for 6 month (the last
internship required by the Bar school, at last!) I also joined French
Data Network, La Quadrature du Net and the Federation of
Do-It-Yourself Internet access/service providers in a lawsuit against
the French government on Data Retention.

This is just the beginning, but I'm quite thrilled about it already.

If you read French, Benjamin Bayart will give you a good idea of what
it's about [on FDN's blog](http://blog.fdn.fr/?post/2015/02/18/Recours-contre-le-decret-2014-1576).


/me, now catching up on email of the week.
