I like to consider myself a [Turing complete user][turinguser]. This is a
concept I discovered in a [fascinating essay][turinguser] written
by [Olia Lialina](http://art.teleportacia.org/olia.html) on the
*concept of users* in computing, and the trend best embodied by
Apple to destroy users and all they stand for.

I guess on of the reasons I liked the article is that I totally
recognise myself in this concept of Turing complete user. But I
also find a little bit sad that this is not a widespread species.

But I can't believe it's going to stay that way indefinitely.
Eventually maybe people are going to stop putting up with how bad
their computers respond to them and start doing something about
it. Maybe [[!toggle id="lifecam" text="Jan-Christoph"]] should start a series: “I hate
technology.”

I just noticed how it's funny that [Jan's homepage][jcborh] currently features a
[collage](http://jancborchardt.net/img/2010-06-14-web.jpg) of
pictures taken for 24 hours while he was wearing a camera on his
chest. Do you see the resemblance with the picture chosen by Olia
to represent the user?

One step towards this is this excellent project, [Revealing errors](http://revealingerrors.com/).

Anyway, I encourage you to read the [essay][turinguser] or if
that's more your style there's a video from the last CCC in
Hamburg:
