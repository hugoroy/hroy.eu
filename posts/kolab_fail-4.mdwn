After I upgraded from Kolab 3.0 to 3.1, hoping it would solve the
SMTP issue (i.e. I could not send email from the roundcube app
freshly setup by the kolab script! Same problem with msmtp…), I
ended up with another broken kolab instance: Roundcube wouldn't
connect to the database any more. When I was trying to restart
kolab's service, all I got was:

    root@totosh:/home/hrd# service kolab-saslauthd start
    root@totosh:/home/hrd# Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/saslauthd/__init__.py", line 114, in run

       import auth_cache
    ImportError: No module named auth_cache

Quite fed up, I tried to re-install the thing again. Yes, I'm
trying really hard to make this work.

So this time, I followed the [not-yet-official
docs](http://hosted.kolabsys.com/~vanmeeuwen/build/html/installation-guide/setup-kolab.html#install-setup-kolab)
which are up-to-date to deal with kolab 3.1, the latest release
version.

During the setup, I got this:

    Please supply a Kolab Service account password. This account is used by various
    services such as Postfix, and Roundcube, as anonymous binds to the LDAP server
    will not be allowed.

    Kolab Service password [xxxxxxxxxxxxxx]:

Yet again, on a completely fresh Debian wheezy, Kolab's setup
failed.

The conclusion, that others have got to on the IRC channel (hello
bertie if you read this!) is that Kolab was not working on Debian
at that point.

So I'm now trying CentOS, which I never used… I’m not too happy to
have to try to get used to a whole new system just to run Kolab. But
I guess it can't hurt to learn a little bit about CentOS and since
the machine's only purpose is actually to run Kolab, it seems like
the best choice.

Fortunately now, some people are contributing to [fix the Debian
packages of Kolab](/posts/looking_forward_mozfest/). I'll try again in the future!
