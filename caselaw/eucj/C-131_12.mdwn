# Judgment

<span id="para1">1.</span>        This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the
interpretation of Article 2(b) and (d), Article 4(1)(a) and (c),
Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14
of Directive [95/46/EC][directive95_46] of the European Parliament and of the Council of
24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ
1995 L 281, p. 31) and of Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
of the European Union (‘the Charter’).

<span id="para2">2.</span>        The request has been made in proceedings between, on the one
hand, Google Spain SL (‘Google Spain’) and Google Inc. and, on the
other, the Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (Spanish Data
Protection Agency; ‘the AEPD’) and Mr Costeja González concerning a
decision by the AEPD upholding the complaint lodged by Mr Costeja
González against those two companies and ordering Google Inc. to adopt
the measures necessary to withdraw personal data relating to Mr Costeja
González from its index and to prevent access to the data in the future.

## Legal context

### European Union law

<span id="para3">3.</span>        Directive [95/46][directive95_46] which, according to Article 1, has the object
of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons,
and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing
of personal data, and of removing obstacles to the free flow of such
data, states in recitals 2, 10, 18 to 20 and 25 in its preamble:

> ‘(2)      … data-processing systems are designed to serve man; … they
> must, whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect
> their fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, and
> contribute to … the well-being of individuals;
> 
> ...
> 
> (10)      … the object of the national laws on the processing of
> personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the
> right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article 8 of the European
> Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
> [, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950,] and in the general principles of
> Community law; … for that reason, the approximation of those laws must
> not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on
> the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the
> Community;
> 
> ...
> 
> (18)      … in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the
> protection to which they are entitled under this Directive, any
> processing of personal data in the Community must be carried out in
> accordance with the law of one of the Member States; … in this
> connection, processing carried out under the responsibility of a
> controller who is established in a Member State should be governed by
> the law of that State;
> 
> (19)      … establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the
> effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements; …
> the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply [a] branch or a
> subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in
> this respect; … when a single controller is established on the territory
> of several Member States, particularly by means of subsidiaries, he must
> ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each
> of the establishments fulfils the obligations imposed by the national
> law applicable to its activities;
> 
> (20)      … the fact that the processing of data is carried out by a
> person established in a third country must not stand in the way of the
> protection of individuals provided for in this Directive; … in these
> cases, the processing should be governed by the law of the Member State
> in which the means used are located, and there should be guarantees to
> ensure that the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive
> are respected in practice;
> 
> ...
> 
> (25)      … the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one
> hand, in the obligations imposed on persons … responsible for
> processing, in particular regarding data quality, technical security,
> notification to the supervisory authority, and the circumstances under
> which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the
> right conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of
> processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult
> the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in
> certain circumstances’.
> 

<span id="para4">4.</span>        Article 2 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] states that ‘[f]or the purposes of
this Directive:

> (a)      “personal data” shall mean any information relating to an
> identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an
> identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or
> indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to
> one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental,
> economic, cultural or social identity;
> 
> (b)       “processing of personal data” (“processing”) shall mean any
> operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data,
> whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording,
> organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
> consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
> otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure
> or destruction;
> 
> ...
> 
> (d)      “controller” shall mean the natural or legal person, public
> authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others
> determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;
> where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or
> Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria
> for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law;
> 
> ...’

<span id="para5">5.</span>        Article 3 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], entitled ‘Scope’, states in
paragraph 1:

> ‘This Directive shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or
> partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by
> automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or
> are intended to form part of a filing system.’

<span id="para6">6.</span>       Article 4 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], entitled ‘National law
applicable’, provides:

> ‘1.      Each Member State shall apply the national provisions it adopts
> pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data where:
> 
> (a)      the processing is carried out in the context of the activities
> of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member
> State; when the same controller is established on the territory of
> several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure
> that each of these establishments complies with the obligations laid
> down by the national law applicable;
> 
> (b)      the controller is not established on the Member State’s
> territory, but in a place where its national law applies by virtue of
> international public law;      
> 
> (c)      the controller is not established on Community territory and,
> for purposes of processing personal data makes use of equipment,
> automated or otherwise, situated on the territory of the said Member
> State, unless such equipment is used only for purposes of transit

> 
> 2.      In the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1(c), the

<span id="para7">7.</span>        In Section I (entitled ‘Principles relating to data quality’)
of Chapter II of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], Article 6 is worded as follows:

> ‘1.      Member States shall provide that personal data must be:
>

> 
> (d)      accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every

> 
> (e)      kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects

> periods for historical, statistical or scientific use.

> 2.      It shall be for the controller to ensure that paragraph 1 is
> complied with.’

<span id="para8">8.</span>        In Section II (entitled ‘Criteria for making data processing
legitimate’) of Chapter II of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], Article 7 provides:

> ‘Member States shall provide that personal data may be processed only
> if:
> 
> ...
> 
> (f)      processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
> interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to
> whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden

> subject which require protection under Article 1(1).’

<span id="para9">9.</span>        Article 9 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], entitled ‘Processing of personal
data and freedom of expression’, provides:

> ‘Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from the

### Spanish law

<span id="para13">13.</span>      Directive [95/46][directive95_46] was transposed into Spanish Law by Organic Law
No 15/1999 of 13 December 1999 on the protection of personal data (BOE
No 298 of 14 December 1999, p. 43088).

## The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling

<span id="para14">14.</span>      On 5 March 2010, Mr Costeja González, a Spanish national
resident in Spain, lodged with the AEPD a complaint against La
Vanguardia Ediciones SL, which publishes a daily newspaper with a large
circulation, in particular in Catalonia (Spain) (‘La Vanguardia’), and
against Google Spain and Google Inc. The complaint was based on the fact
that, when an internet user entered Mr Costeja González’s name in the
search engine of the Google group (‘Google Search’), he would obtain
links to two pages of La Vanguardia’s newspaper, of 19 January and
9 March 1998 respectively, on which an announcement mentioning
Mr Costeja González’s name appeared for a real-estate auction connected
with attachment proceedings for the recovery of social security debts.

<span id="para15">15.</span>      By that complaint, Mr Costeja González requested, first, that La
Vanguardia be required either to remove or alter those pages so that the
personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tools
made available by search engines in order to protect the data. Second,
he requested that Google Spain or Google Inc. be required to remove or
conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be
included in the search results and no longer appeared in the links to La
Vanguardia. Mr Costeja González stated in this context that the
attachment proceedings concerning him had been fully resolved for a
number of years and that reference to them was now entirely irrelevant.

<span id="para16">16.</span>      By decision of 30 July 2010, the AEPD rejected the complaint in
so far as it related to La Vanguardia, taking the view that the
publication by it of the information in question was legally justified
as it took place upon order of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs
and was intended to give maximum publicity to the auction in order to
secure as many bidders as possible.

<span id="para17">17.</span>      On the other hand, the complaint was upheld in so far as it was
directed against Google Spain and Google Inc. The AEPD considered in
this regard that operators of search engines are subject to data
protection legislation given that they carry out data processing for
which they are responsible and act as intermediaries in the information
society. The AEPD took the view that it has the power to require the
withdrawal of data and the prohibition of access to certain data by the
operators of search engines when it considers that the locating and
dissemination of the data are liable to compromise the fundamental right
to data protection and the dignity of persons in the broad sense, and
this would also encompass the mere wish of the person concerned that
such data not be known to third parties. The AEPD considered that that
obligation may be owed directly by operators of search engines, without
it being necessary to erase the data or information from the website
where they appear, including when retention of the information on that
site is justified by a statutory provision.

<span id="para18">18.</span>      Google Spain and Google Inc. brought separate actions against
that decision before the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court). The
Audiencia Nacional joined the actions.

<span id="para19">19.</span>      That court states in the order for reference that the actions
raise the question of what obligations are owed by operators of search
engines to protect personal data of persons concerned who do not wish
that certain information, which is published on third parties’ websites
and contains personal data relating to them that enable that information
to be linked to them, be located, indexed and made available to internet
users indefinitely. The answer to that question depends on the way in
which Directive [95/46][directive95_46] must be interpreted in the context of these
technologies, which appeared after the directive’s publication.

<span id="para20">20.</span>      In those circumstances, the Audiencia Nacional decided to stay
the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a
preliminary ruling:

> 1.      With regard to the territorial application of Directive [[95/46][directive95_46]]
> and, consequently, of the Spanish data protection legislation:
> 
> (a)      must it be considered that an “establishment”, within the
> meaning of Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], exists when any one or
> more of the following circumstances arise:
> 
> –        when the undertaking providing the search engine sets up in a
> Member State an office or subsidiary for the purpose of promoting and
> selling advertising space on the search engine, which orientates its
> activity towards the inhabitants of that State,
> 
> or
> 
> –        when the parent company designates a subsidiary located in that
> Member State as its representative and controller for two specific
> filing systems which relate to the data of customers who have contracted
> for advertising with that undertaking,
> 
> or
> 
> –        when the office or subsidiary established in a Member State
> forwards to the parent company, located outside the European Union,
> requests and requirements addressed to it both by data subjects and by
> the authorities with responsibility for ensuring observation of the
> right to data protection, even where such collaboration is engaged in
> voluntarily?
> 
> (b)      Must Article 4(1)(c) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] be interpreted as
> meaning that there is “use of equipment … situated on the territory of
> the said Member State”:
> 
> –        when a search engine uses crawlers or robots to locate and
> index information contained in web pages located on servers in that
> Member State,
> 
> or
> 
> –        when it uses a domain name pertaining to a Member State and
> arranges for searches and the results thereof to be based on the
> language of that Member State?
> 
> (c)      Is it possible to regard as a use of equipment, in the terms of
> Article 4(1)(c) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], the temporary storage of the
> information indexed by internet search engines? If the answer to that
> question is affirmative, can it be considered that that connecting
> factor is present when the undertaking refuses to disclose the place
> where it stores those indexes, invoking reasons of competition?
> 
> (d)      Regardless of the answers to the foregoing questions and
> particularly in the event that the Court … considers that the connecting
> factors referred to in Article 4 of [Directive [95/46][directive95_46]] are not present:
> 
> must Directive [95/46][directive95_46] … be applied, in the light of Article 8 of the
> [Charter], in the Member State where the centre of gravity of the
> conflict is located and more effective protection of the rights of …
> Union citizens is possible?
> 
> 2.      As regards the activity of search engines as providers of
> content in relation to Directive [95/46][directive95_46] …:
> 
> (a)      in relation to the activity of [Google Search], as a provider
> of content, consisting in locating information published or included on
> the net by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it
> temporarily and finally making it available to internet users according
> to a particular order of preference, when that information contains
> personal data of third parties: must an activity like the one described
> be interpreted as falling within the concept of “processing of … data”
> used in Article 2(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46]?
> 
> (b)      If the answer to the foregoing question is affirmative, and
> once again in relation to an activity like the one described:
> 
> must Article 2(d) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] be interpreted as meaning that the
> undertaking managing [Google Search] is to be regarded as the
> “controller” of the personal data contained in the web pages that it
> indexes?
> 
> (c)      In the event that the answer to the foregoing question is
> affirmative:
> 
> may the [AEPD], protecting the rights embodied in [Article] 12(b) and
> [subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14] of Directive
> [95/46][directive95_46], directly impose on [Google Search] a requirement that it withdraw
> from its indexes an item of information published by third parties,
> without addressing itself in advance or simultaneously to the owner of
> the web page on which that information is located?
> 
> (d)      In the event that the answer to the foregoing question is
> affirmative:
> 
> would the obligation of search engines to protect those rights be
> excluded when the information that contains the personal data has been
> lawfully published by third parties and is kept on the web page from
> which it originates?
> 
> 3.      Regarding the scope of the right of erasure and/or the right to
> object, in relation to the “derecho al olvido” (the “right to be
> forgotten”), the following question is asked:
> 
> must it be considered that the rights to erasure and blocking of data,
> provided for in Article 12(b), and the right to object, provided for by
> [subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14] of Directive
> [95/46][directive95_46], extend to enabling the data subject to address himself to search
> engines in order to prevent indexing of the information relating to him
> personally, published on third parties’ web pages, invoking his wish
> that such information should not be known to internet users when he
> considers that it might be prejudicial to him or he wishes it to be
> consigned to oblivion, even though the information in question has been
> lawfully published by third parties?’

## Consideration of the questions referred

### Question 2(a) and (b), concerning the material scope of Directive [95/46][directive95_46]

<span id="para21">21.</span>      By Question 2(a) and (b), which it is appropriate to examine
first, the referring court asks, in essence, whether [[!toggle id="art2a-1" text="Article 2(b) of
Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46] is to be interpreted as meaning that the activity of a
search engine as a provider of content which consists in finding
information published or placed on the internet by third parties,
indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making
it available to internet users according to a particular order of
preference must be classified as ‘processing of personal data’ within
the meaning of that provision when that information contains personal
data. If the answer is in the affirmative, the referring court seeks to
ascertain furthermore whether [[!toggle id="art2d-1" text="Article 2(d) of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46] is to be
interpreted as meaning that the operator of a search engine must be
regarded as the ‘controller’ in respect of that processing of the
personal data, within the meaning of that provision.

[[!toggleable id="art2a-1" text="""
> (a)      “personal data” shall mean any information relating to an
> identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an
> identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or
> indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to
> one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental,
> economic, cultural or social identity;
"""]]
[[!toggleable id="art2d-1" text="""
> (d)      “controller” shall mean the natural or legal person, public
> authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others
> determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;
> where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or
> Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria
> for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law;
"""]]

<span id="para22">22.</span>      According to Google Spain and Google Inc., the activity of
search engines cannot be regarded as processing of the data which appear
on third parties’ web pages displayed in the list of search results,
given that search engines process all the information available on the
internet without effecting a selection between personal data and other
information. Furthermore, even if that activity must be classified as
‘data processing’, the operator of a search engine cannot be regarded as
a ‘controller’ in respect of that processing since it has no knowledge
of those data and does not exercise control over the data.

<span id="para23">23.</span>      On the other hand, Mr Costeja González, the Spanish, Italian,
Austrian and Polish Governments and the European Commission consider
that that activity quite clearly involves ‘data processing’ within the
meaning of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], which is distinct from the data processing
by the publishers of websites and pursues different objectives from such
processing. The operator of a search engine is the ‘controller’ in
respect of the data processing carried out by it since it is the
operator that determines the purposes and means of that processing.

<span id="para24">24.</span>      In the Greek Government’s submission, the activity in question
constitutes such ‘processing’, but inasmuch as search engines serve
merely as intermediaries, the undertakings which operate them cannot be
regarded as ‘controllers’, except where they store data in an
‘intermediate memory’ or ‘cache memory’ for a period which exceeds that
which is technically necessary.

<span id="para25">25.</span>      Article 2(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] defines ‘processing of personal
data’ as 

> ‘any operation or set of operations which is performed upon
personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection,
recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure
or destruction’.

<span id="para26">26.</span>      As regards in particular the internet, the Court has already had
occasion to state that the operation of loading personal data on an
internet page must be considered to be such ‘processing’ within the
meaning of Article 2(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] (see Case [C-101/01]
*Lindqvist* EU:C:2003:596, paragraph 25).

<span id="para27">27.</span>      So far as concerns the activity at issue in the main
proceedings, it is not contested that the data found, indexed and stored
by search engines and made available to their users include information
relating to identified or identifiable natural persons and thus
‘personal data’ within the meaning of [[!toggle id="art2a-1" text="Article 2(a) of that directive"]].

[[!toggleable id="art2a-1" text="""
> (a)      “personal data” shall mean any information relating to an
> identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an
> identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or
> indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to
> one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental,
> economic, cultural or social identity;
"""]]

<span id="para28">28.</span>      Therefore, it must be found that, in exploring the internet
automatically, constantly and systematically in search of the
information which is published there, the operator of a search engine
‘collects’ such data which it subsequently ‘retrieves’, ‘records’ and
‘organises’ within the framework of its indexing programmes, ‘stores’ on
its servers and, as the case may be, ‘discloses’ and ‘makes available’
to its users in the form of lists of search results. As those operations
are referred to expressly and unconditionally in Article 2(b) of
Directive [95/46][directive95_46], they must be classified as ‘processing’ within the
meaning of that provision, regardless of the fact that the operator of
the search engine also carries out the same operations in respect of
other types of information and does not distinguish between the latter
and the personal data.

<span id="para29">29.</span>      Nor is the foregoing finding affected by the fact that those
data have already been published on the internet and are not altered by
the search engine.

<span id="para30">30.</span>      The Court has already held that the operations referred to in
Article 2(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] must also be classified as such
processing where they exclusively concern material that has already been
published in unaltered form in the media. It has indeed observed in that
regard that a general derogation from the application of Directive [95/46][directive95_46]
in such a case would largely deprive the directive of its effect (see,
to this effect, Case [C-73/07] *Satakunnan Markkinapörssi and Satamedia*
EU:C:2008:727, paragraphs 48 and 49).

<span id="para31">31.</span>      Furthermore, it follows from the definition contained in
Article 2(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] that, whilst the alteration of personal
data indeed constitutes processing within the meaning of the directive,
the other operations which are mentioned there do not, on the other
hand, in any way require that the personal data be altered.

<span id="para32">32.</span>      As to the question whether the operator of a search engine must
be regarded as the ‘controller’ in respect of the processing of personal
data that is carried out by that engine in the context of an activity
such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it should be recalled
that Article 2(d) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] defines ‘controller’ as 

>‘the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which
alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data’.

<span id="para33">33.</span>      It is the search engine operator which determines the purposes
and means of that activity and thus of the processing of personal data
that it itself carries out within the framework of that activity and
which must, consequently, be regarded as the ‘controller’ in respect of
that processing pursuant to Article 2(d).

<span id="para34">34.</span>      Furthermore, it would be contrary not only to the clear wording
of that provision but also to its objective — which is to ensure,
through a broad definition of the concept of ‘controller’, effective and
complete protection of data subjects — to exclude the operator of a
search engine from that definition on the ground that it does not
exercise control over the personal data published on the web pages of
third parties.

<span id="para35">35.</span>      In this connection, it should be pointed out that the processing
of personal data carried out in the context of the activity of a search
engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out
by publishers of websites, consisting in loading those data on an
internet page.

<span id="para36">36.</span>      Moreover, it is undisputed that that activity of search engines
plays a decisive role in the overall dissemination of those data in that
it renders the latter accessible to any internet user making a search on
the basis of the data subject’s name, including to internet users who
otherwise would not have found the web page on which those data are
published.

<span id="para37">37.</span>      Also, the organisation and aggregation of information published
on the internet that are effected by search engines with the aim of
facilitating their users’ access to that information may, when users
carry out their search on the basis of an individual’s name, result in
them obtaining through the list of results a structured overview of the
information relating to that individual that can be found on the
internet enabling them to establish a more or less detailed profile of
the data subject.

<span id="para38">38.</span>      Inasmuch as the activity of a search engine is therefore liable
to affect significantly, and additionally compared with that of the
publishers of websites, the fundamental rights to privacy and to the
protection of personal data, the operator of the search engine as the
person determining the purposes and means of that activity must ensure,
within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities,
that the activity meets the requirements of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] in order
that the guarantees laid down by the directive may have full effect and
that effective and complete protection of data subjects, in particular
of their right to privacy, may actually be achieved.

<span id="para39">39.</span>      Finally, the fact that publishers of websites have the option of
indicating to operators of search engines, by means in particular of
exclusion protocols such as ‘robot.txt’ or codes such as ‘noindex’ or
‘noarchive’, that they wish specific information published on their site
to be wholly or partially excluded from the search engines’ automatic
indexes does not mean that, if publishers of websites do not so
indicate, the operator of a search engine is released from its
responsibility for the processing of personal data that it carries out
in the context of the engine’s activity.

<span id="para40">40.</span>      That fact does not alter the position that the purposes and
means of that processing are determined by the operator of the search
engine. Furthermore, even if that option for publishers of websites were
to mean that they determine the means of that processing jointly with
that operator, this finding would not remove any of the latter’s
responsibility as [[!toggle id="art-40" text="Article 2(d) of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46] expressly provides
that that determination may be made ‘alone or jointly with others’.

[[!toggleable id="art-40" text="""

> Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria
> for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law;
"""]]

<span id="para41">41.</span>      It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the answer
to Question 2(a) and (b) is that [[!toggle id="art-41" text="Article 2(b) and (d) of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46]
are to be interpreted as meaning that, first, the activity of a search
engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the
internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it
temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users
according to a particular order of preference must be classified as
‘processing of personal data’ within the meaning of Article 2(b) when
that information contains personal data and, second, the operator of the
search engine must be regarded as the ‘controller’ in respect of that
processing, within the meaning of Article 2(d).

[[!toggleable id="art-41" text="""

### Question 1(a) to (d), concerning the territorial scope of Directive [95/46][directive95_46]

<span id="para42">42.</span>      By Question 1(a) to (d), the referring court seeks to establish
whether it is possible to apply the national legislation transposing
Directive [95/46][directive95_46] in circumstances such as those at issue in the main
proceedings.

<span id="para43">43.</span>      In this respect, the referring court has established the
following facts:

–        Google Search is offered worldwide through the website
‘www.google.com’. In numerous States, a local version adapted to the
national language exists. The version of Google Search in Spanish is
offered through the website ‘www.google.es’, which has been registered
since 16 September 2003. Google Search is one of the most used search
engines in Spain.

–        Google Search is operated by Google Inc., which is the parent
company of the Google Group and has its seat in the United States.

–        Google Search indexes websites throughout the world, including
websites located in Spain. The information indexed by its ‘web crawlers’
or robots, that is to say, computer programmes used to locate and sweep
up the content of web pages methodically and automatically, is stored
temporarily on servers whose State of location is unknown, that being
kept secret for reasons of competition.

–        Google Search does not merely give access to content hosted on
the indexed websites, but takes advantage of that activity and includes,
in return for payment, advertising associated with the internet users’
search terms, for undertakings which wish to use that tool in order to
offer their goods or services to the internet users.

–        The Google group has recourse to its subsidiary Google Spain
for promoting the sale of advertising space generated on the website
‘www.google.com’. Google Spain, which was established on 3 September
2003 and possesses separate legal personality, has its seat in Madrid
(Spain). Its activities are targeted essentially at undertakings based
in Spain, acting as a commercial agent for the Google group in that
Member State. Its objects are to promote, facilitate and effect the sale
of on-line advertising products and services to third parties and the
marketing of that advertising.

–        Google Inc. designated Google Spain as the controller, in
Spain, in respect of two filing systems registered by Google Inc. with
the AEPD; those filing systems were intended to contain the personal
data of the customers who had concluded contracts for advertising
services with Google Inc.

<span id="para44">44.</span>      Specifically, the main issues raised by the referring court
concern the notion of ‘establishment’, within the meaning of
Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], and of ‘use of equipment situated on
the territory of the said Member State’, within the meaning of
Article 4(1)(c).

#### Question 1(a)

[[!toggleable id="art41a" text="""
> ‘1.      Each Member State shall apply the national provisions it adopts
> pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data where:
> 
> (a)      the processing is carried out in the context of the activities

> State; when the same controller is established on the territory of
> several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure
> that each of these establishments complies with the obligations laid
> down by the national law applicable;
"""]]

<span id="para45">45.</span>      By Question 1(a), the referring court asks, in essence, whether
[[!toggle id="art41a" text="Article 4(1)(a) of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46] is to be interpreted as meaning that
processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the
activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a
Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when one or more of
the following three conditions are met:

–        the operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a
branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising
space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards
the inhabitants of that Member State, or

–        the parent company designates a subsidiary located in that
Member State as its representative and controller for two specific
filing systems which relate to the data of customers who have contracted
for advertising with that undertaking, or

–        the branch or subsidiary established in a Member State forwards
to the parent company, located outside the European Union, requests and
requirements addressed to it both by data subjects and by the
authorities with responsibility for ensuring observation of the right to
protection of personal data, even where such collaboration is engaged in
voluntarily.

<span id="para46">46.</span>      So far as concerns the first of those three conditions, the
referring court states that Google Search is operated and managed by
Google Inc. and that it has not been established that Google Spain
carries out in Spain an activity directly linked to the indexing or
storage of information or data contained on third parties’ websites.
Nevertheless, according to the referring court, the promotion and sale
of advertising space, which Google Spain attends to in respect of Spain,
constitutes the bulk of the Google group’s commercial activity and may
be regarded as closely linked to Google Search.

<span id="para47">47.</span>      Mr Costeja González, the Spanish, Italian, Austrian and Polish
Governments and the Commission submit that, in the light of the
inextricable link between the activity of the search engine operated by
Google Inc. and the activity of Google Spain, the latter must be
regarded as an establishment of the former and the processing of
personal data is carried out in context of the activities of that
establishment. On the other hand, according to Google Spain, Google Inc.
and the Greek Government, Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] is not
applicable in the case of the first of the three conditions listed by
the referring court.

<span id="para48">48.</span>      In this regard, it is to be noted first of all that recital 19
in the preamble to Directive [95/46][directive95_46] states that ‘establishment on the
territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of
activity through stable arrangements’ and that ‘the legal form of such
an establishment, whether simply [a] branch or a subsidiary with a legal
personality, is not the determining factor’.

<span id="para49">49.</span>      It is not disputed that Google Spain engages in the effective
and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements in Spain. As
it moreover has separate legal personality, it constitutes a subsidiary
of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and, therefore, an ‘establishment’
within the meaning of Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46].

<span id="para50">50.</span>      In order to satisfy the criterion laid down in that provision,
it is also necessary that the processing of personal data by the
controller be ‘carried out in the context of the activities’ of an
establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State.

<span id="para51">51.</span>      Google Spain and Google Inc. dispute that this is the case since
the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings is
carried out exclusively by Google Inc., which operates Google Search
without any intervention on the part of Google Spain; the latter’s
activity is limited to providing support to the Google group’s
advertising activity which is separate from its search engine service.

<span id="para52">52.</span>      Nevertheless, as the Spanish Government and the Commission in
particular have pointed out, Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] does not
require the processing of personal data in question to be carried out
‘by’ the establishment concerned itself, but only that it be carried out
‘in the context of the activities’ of the establishment.

<span id="para53">53.</span>      Furthermore, in the light of the objective of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] of
ensuring effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and
freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy,
with respect to the processing of personal data, those words cannot be
interpreted restrictively (see, by analogy, Case [C-324/09] *L'Oréal and
Others* EU:C:2011:474, paragraphs 62 and 63).

<span id="para54">54.</span>      It is to be noted in this context that it is clear in particular
from [[!toggle id="recitals1820" text="recitals 18 to 20 in the preamble to Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46] and Article 4
thereof that the European Union legislature sought to prevent
individuals from being deprived of the protection guaranteed by the
directive and that protection from being circumvented, by prescribing a
particularly broad territorial scope.

[[!toggleable id="recitals1820" text="""
> (18)      … in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the
> protection to which they are entitled under this Directive, any
> processing of personal data in the Community must be carried out in

> connection, processing carried out under the responsibility of a

> 
> (19)      … establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the
> effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements; …
> the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply [a] branch or a

> this respect; … when a single controller is established on the territory

> ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each
> of the establishments fulfils the obligations imposed by the national
> law applicable to its activities;
> 
> (20)      … the fact that the processing of data is carried out by a
> person established in a third country must not stand in the way of the
> protection of individuals provided for in this Directive; … in these
> cases, the processing should be governed by the law of the Member State
> in which the means used are located, and there should be guarantees to
> ensure that the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive
> are respected in practice;
"""]]

<span id="para55">55.</span>      In the light of that objective of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] and of the
wording of [[!toggle id="41a-55" text="Article 4(1)(a)"]], it must be held that the processing of
personal data for the purposes of the service of a search engine such as
Google Search, which is operated by an undertaking that has its seat in
a third State but has an establishment in a Member State, is carried out
‘in the context of the activities’ of that establishment if the latter
is intended to promote and sell, in that Member State, advertising space
offered by the search engine which serves to make the service offered by
that engine profitable.

[[!toggleable id="41a-55" text="""
> ‘1.      Each Member State shall apply the national provisions it adopts
> pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data where:
> 
> (a)      the processing is carried out in the context of the activities

> State; when the same controller is established on the territory of
> several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure
> that each of these establishments complies with the obligations laid
> down by the national law applicable;
"""]]

<span id="para56">56.</span>      In such circumstances, the activities of the operator of the
search engine and those of its establishment situated in the Member
State concerned are inextricably linked since the activities relating to
the advertising space constitute the means of rendering the search
engine at issue economically profitable and that engine is, at the same
time, the means enabling those activities to be performed.

<span id="para57">57.</span>      As has been stated in [paragraphs 26](#para26) to 28 of the present
judgment, the very display of personal data on a search results page
constitutes processing of such data. Since that display of results is
accompanied, on the same page, by the display of advertising linked to
the search terms, it is clear that the processing of personal data in
question is carried out in the context of the commercial and advertising
activity of the controller’s establishment on the territory of a Member
State, in this instance Spanish territory.

<span id="para58">58.</span>      That being so, it cannot be accepted that the processing of
personal data carried out for the purposes of the operation of the
search engine should escape the obligations and guarantees laid down by
Directive [95/46][directive95_46], which would compromise the directive’s effectiveness
and the effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and
freedoms of natural persons which the directive seeks to ensure (see, by
analogy, *L'Oréal and Others* EU:C:2011:474, paragraphs 62 and 63), in
particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of
personal data, a right to which the directive accords special importance
as is confirmed in particular by [[!toggle id="art1-58" text="Article 1(1) thereof"]] 
and [[!toggle id="rec210" text="recitals 2 and 10 in its preamble"]]
(see, to this effect, Joined Cases [C-465/00], [C-138/01]
and [C-139/01] *Österreichischer Rundfunk and Others* EU:C:2003:294,
paragraph 70; Case [C-553/07] *Rijkeboer* EU:C:2009:293, paragraph 47; and
Case [C-473/12] *IPI* EU:C:2013:715, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).

[[!toggleable id="art1-58" text="""

"""]]

<span id="para59">59.</span>      Since the first of the three conditions listed by the referring
court suffices by itself for it to be concluded that an establishment
such as Google Spain satisfies the criterion laid down in
Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], it is unnecessary to examine the
other two conditions.

<span id="para60">60.</span>      It follows from the foregoing that the answer to Question 1(a)
is that Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] is to be interpreted as
meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context
of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory
of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when the
operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or
subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space
offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the
inhabitants of that Member State.

#### Question 1(b) to (d)

<span id="para61">61.</span>      In view of the answer given to Question 1(a), there is no need
to answer Question 1(b) to (d).

### Question 2(c) and (d), concerning the extent of the responsibility of the operator of a search engine under Directive [95/46][directive95_46]

<span id="para62">62.</span>      By Question 2(c) and (d), the referring court asks, in essence,
whether [[!toggle id="art12b" text="Article 12(b)"]] and [[!toggle id="art14a" text="subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14"]] 
of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] are to be interpreted as meaning that, in
order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions, the
operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of
results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person’s
name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing
information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or
information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web
pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on
those pages is lawful.

"""]]

<span id="para63">63.</span>      Google Spain and Google Inc. submit that, by virtue of the
principle of proportionality, any request seeking the removal of
information must be addressed to the publisher of the website concerned
because it is he who takes the responsibility for making the information
public, who is in a position to appraise the lawfulness of that
publication and who has available to him the most effective and least
restrictive means of making the information inaccessible. Furthermore,
to require the operator of a search engine to withdraw information
published on the internet from its indexes would take insufficient
account of the fundamental rights of publishers of websites, of other
internet users and of that operator itself.

<span id="para64">64.</span>      According to the Austrian Government, a national supervisory
authority may order such an operator to erase information published by
third parties from its filing systems only if the data in question have
been found previously to be unlawful or incorrect or if the data subject
has made a successful objection to the publisher of the website on which
that information was published.

<span id="para65">65.</span>      Mr Costeja González, the Spanish, Italian and Polish Governments
and the Commission submit that the national authority may directly order
the operator of a search engine to withdraw from its indexes and
intermediate memory information containing personal data that has been
published by third parties, without having to approach beforehand or
simultaneously the publisher of the web page on which that information
appears. Furthermore, according to Mr Costeja González, the Spanish and
Italian Governments and the Commission, the fact that the information
has been published lawfully and that it still appears on the original
web page has no effect on the obligations of that operator under
Directive [95/46][directive95_46]. On the other hand, according to the Polish Government
that fact is such as to release the operator from its obligations.

<span id="para66">66.</span>      First of all, it should be remembered that, as is apparent from
Article 1 and recital 10 in the preamble, Directive [95/46][directive95_46] seeks to
ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms
of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect
to the processing of personal data (see, to this effect,
*IPI*EU:C:2013:715, paragraph 28).

<span id="para67">67.</span>      According to recital 25 in the preamble to Directive [95/46][directive95_46], the
principles of protection laid down by the directive are reflected, on
the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons responsible for
processing, in particular regarding data quality, technical security,
notification to the supervisory authority and the circumstances under
which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the
rights conferred on individuals whose data are the subject of processing
to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to
request corrections and even to object to processing in certain
circumstances.

<span id="para68">68.</span>      The Court has already held that the provisions of Directive
[95/46][directive95_46], in so far as they govern the processing of personal data liable
to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy,
must necessarily be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights,
which, according to settled case-law, form an integral part of the
general principles of law whose observance the Court ensures and which

<span id="para69">69.</span>      Article 7 of the Charter guarantees the right to respect for
private life, whilst Article 8 of the Charter expressly proclaims the
right to the protection of personal data. Article 8(2) and (3) specify
that such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on
the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other
legitimate basis laid down by law, that everyone has the right of access
to data which have been collected concerning him or her and the right to
have the data rectified, and that compliance with these rules is to be
subject to control by an independent authority. Those requirements are
implemented inter alia by Articles 6, 7, 12, 14 and 28 of Directive

<span id="para70">70.</span>      Article 12(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] provides that Member States are
to guarantee every data subject the right to obtain from the controller,
as appropriate, the rectification, erasure or blocking of data the
processing of which does not comply with the provisions of Directive
[95/46][directive95_46], in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of
the data. As this final point relating to the case where certain
requirements referred to in [[!toggle id="art61d-70" text="Article 6(1)(d) of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46] are not
observed is stated by way of example and is not exhaustive, it follows
that non-compliant nature of the processing, which is capable of
conferring upon the data subject the right guaranteed in [[!toggle id="art12b-70" text="Article 12(b) of the directive"]], 
may also arise from non-observance of the other
conditions of lawfulness that are imposed by the directive upon the

<span id="para72">72.</span>      Under Article 6 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] and without prejudice to
specific provisions that the Member States may lay down in respect of
processing for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, the
controller has the task of ensuring that personal data are processed
‘fairly and lawfully’, that they are ‘collected for specified, explicit
and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible
with those purposes’, that they are ‘adequate, relevant and not
excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected
and/or further processed’, that they are ‘accurate and, where necessary,
kept up to date’ and, finally, that they are ‘kept in a form which
permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary
for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are
further processed’. In this context, the controller must take every
reasonable step to ensure that data which do not meet the requirements
of that provision are erased or rectified.

<span id="para73">73.</span>      As regards legitimation, under Article 7 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], of
processing such as that at issue in the main proceedings carried out by
the operator of a search engine, that processing is capable of being
covered by the ground in Article 7(f).

<span id="para74">74.</span>      This provision permits the processing of personal data where it
is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are
disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests
or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject — in particular
his right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data —
which require protection under [[!toggle id="art1-74" text="Article 1(1) of the directive"]].
Application of Article 7(f) thus necessitates a balancing of the
opposing rights and interests concerned, in the context of which account
must be taken of the significance of the data subject’s rights arising
from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (see *ASNEF and FECEMD*,

<span id="para76">76.</span>      Under subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14 of

directive, to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds
relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating
to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. The
balancing to be carried out under subparagraph (a) of the first
paragraph of Article 14 thus enables account to be taken in a more
specific manner of all the circumstances surrounding the data subject’s
particular situation. Where there is a justified objection, the
processing instigated by the controller may no longer involve those
data.

<span id="para77">77.</span>      Requests under Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first
paragraph of Article 14 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] may be addressed by the data
subject directly to the controller who must then duly examine their
merits and, as the case may be, end processing of the data in question.
Where the controller does not grant the request, the data subject may
bring the matter before the supervisory authority or the judicial
authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the
controller to take specific measures accordingly.

<span id="para78">78.</span>      In this connection, it is to be noted that it is clear from
[[!toggle id="art28-78" text="Article 28(3) and (4)"]] 
of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] that each supervisory authority
is to hear claims lodged by any person concerning the protection of his
rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data and
that it has investigative powers and effective powers of intervention
enabling it to order in particular the blocking, erasure or destruction
of data or to impose a temporary or definitive ban on such processing.

[[!toggleable id="art28-78" text="""

"""]]

<span id="para79">79.</span>      It is in the light of those considerations that it is necessary
to interpret and apply the provisions of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] governing the
data subject’s rights when he lodges with the supervisory authority or
judicial authority a request such as that at issue in the main
proceedings.

<span id="para80">80.</span>      It must be pointed out at the outset that, as has been found in
[paragraphs 36](#para36) to 38 of the present judgment, processing of personal
data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, carried out by the
operator of a search engine is liable to affect significantly the
fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data
when the search by means of that engine is carried out on the basis of
an individual’s name, since that processing enables any internet user to
obtain through the list of results a structured overview of the
information relating to that individual that can be found on the
internet — information which potentially concerns a vast number of
aspects of his private life and which, without the search engine, could
not have been interconnected or could have been only with great
difficulty — and thereby to establish a more or less detailed profile of
him. Furthermore, the effect of the interference with those rights of
the data subject is heightened on account of the important role played
by the internet and search engines in modern society, which render the
information contained in such a list of results ubiquitous (see, to this
effect, Joined Cases [C-509/09] and [C-161/10] *eDate Advertising and
Others* EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 45).

<span id="para81">81.</span>      In the light of the potential seriousness of that interference,
it is clear that it cannot be justified by merely the economic interest
which the operator of such an engine has in that processing. However,
inasmuch as the removal of links from the list of results could,
depending on the information at issue, have effects upon the legitimate
interest of internet users potentially interested in having access to
that information, in situations such as that at issue in the main
proceedings a fair balance should be sought in particular between that
interest and the data subject’s fundamental rights under Articles 7 and
8 of the Charter. Whilst it is true that the data subject’s rights
protected by those articles also override, as a general rule, that
interest of internet users, that balance may however depend, in specific
cases, on the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity
for the data subject’s private life and on the interest of the public in
having that information, an interest which may vary, in particular,
according to the role played by the data subject in public life.

<span id="para82">82.</span>      Following the appraisal of the conditions for the application of
[[!toggle id="art12b-82" text="Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14 of Directive"]]
[95/46][directive95_46] which is to be carried out when a request such as
that at issue in the main proceedings is lodged with it, the supervisory
authority or judicial authority may order the operator of the search
engine to remove from the list of results displayed following a search
made on the basis of a person’s name links to web pages published by
third parties containing information relating to that person, without an
order to that effect presupposing the previous or simultaneous removal
of that name and information — of the publisher’s own accord or
following an order of one of those authorities — from the web page on
which they were published.

"""]]

<span id="para83">83.</span>      As has been established in [paragraphs 35](#para35) to 38 of the present
judgment, inasmuch as the data processing carried out in the context of
the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is
additional to that carried out by publishers of websites and affects the
data subject’s fundamental rights additionally, the operator of the
search engine as the controller in respect of that processing must
ensure, within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and
capabilities, that that processing meets the requirements of Directive
[95/46][directive95_46], in order that the guarantees laid down by the directive may have
full effect.

<span id="para84">84.</span>      Given the ease with which information published on a website can
be replicated on other sites and the fact that the persons responsible
for its publication are not always subject to European Union
legislation, effective and complete protection of data users could not
be achieved if the latter had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure
of the information relating to them from the publishers of websites.

<span id="para85">85.</span>      Furthermore, the processing by the publisher of a web page
consisting in the publication of information relating to an individual
may, in some circumstances, be carried out ‘solely for journalistic
purposes’ and thus benefit, by virtue of [[!toggle id="art9" text="Article 9 of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46],
from derogations from the requirements laid down by the directive,
whereas that does not appear to be so in the case of the processing
carried out by the operator of a search engine. It cannot therefore be
ruled out that in certain circumstances the data subject is capable of
exercising the rights referred to in Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a)
of the first paragraph of Article 14 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] against that
operator but not against the publisher of the web page.

[[!toggleable id="art9" text="""
> ‘Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from the
> provisions of this Chapter, Chapter IV and Chapter VI for the processing
> of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the
> purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to
> reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of
> expression.’
"""]]

<span id="para86">86.</span>      Finally, it must be stated that not only does the ground, under
Article 7 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], justifying the publication of a piece of
personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is
applicable to the activity of search engines, but also, even where that
is the case, the outcome of the weighing of the interests at issue to be
carried out under Article 7(f) and subparagraph (a) of the first
paragraph of Article 14 of the directive may differ according to whether
the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that
carried out by the publisher of the web page is at issue, given that,
first, the legitimate interests justifying the processing may be
different and, second, the consequences of the processing for the data
subject, and in particular for his private life, are not necessarily the
same.

<span id="para87">87.</span>      Indeed, since the inclusion in the list of results, displayed
following a search made on the basis of a person’s name, of a web page
and of the information contained on it relating to that person makes
access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user
making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a
decisive role in the dissemination of that information, it is liable to
constitute a more significant interference with the data subject’s
fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page.

<span id="para88">88.</span>      In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to
Question 2(c) and (d) is that [[!toggle id="art12b88" text="Article 12(b)"]] 
and [[!toggle id="art14a88" text="subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14"]]
of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] are to be interpreted
as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those
provisions and in so far as the conditions laid down by those provisions
are in fact satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to
remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the
basis of a person’s name links to web pages, published by third parties
and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where
that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from
those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in
itself on those pages is lawful.

### Question 3, concerning the scope of the data subject’s rights guaranteed by Directive [95/46][directive95_46]

<span id="para89">89.</span>      By Question 3, the referring court asks, in essence, whether
[[!toggle id="art12b88" text="Article 12(b)"]] 
and [[!toggle id="art14a88" text="subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14"]]
of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] are to be interpreted as enabling the data subject to
require the operator of a search engine to remove from the list of
results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name links
to web pages published lawfully by third parties and containing true
information relating to him, on the ground that that information may be
prejudicial to him or that he wishes it to be ‘forgotten’ after a
certain time.

<span id="para90">90.</span>      Google Spain, Google Inc., the Greek, Austrian and Polish
Governments and the Commission consider that this question should be
answered in the negative. Google Spain, Google Inc., the Polish
Government and the Commission submit in this regard that Article 12(b)
and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14 of Directive
[95/46][directive95_46] confer rights upon data subjects only if the processing in
question is incompatible with the directive or on compelling legitimate
grounds relating to their particular situation, and not merely because
they consider that that processing may be prejudicial to them or they
wish that the data being processed sink into oblivion. The Greek and
Austrian Governments submit that the data subject must approach the
publisher of the website concerned.

<span id="para91">91.</span>      According to Mr Costeja González and the Spanish and Italian
Governments, the data subject may oppose the indexing by a search engine
of personal data relating to him where their dissemination through the
search engine is prejudicial to him and his fundamental rights to the
protection of those data and to privacy — which encompass the ‘right to
be forgotten’ — override the legitimate interests of the operator of the
search engine and the general interest in freedom of information.

<span id="para92">92.</span>      As regards Article 12(b) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], the application of
which is subject to the condition that the processing of personal data
be incompatible with the directive, it should be recalled that, as has
been noted in [paragraph 72](#para72) of the present judgment, such incompatibility
may result not only from the fact that such data are inaccurate but, in
particular, also from the fact that they are inadequate, irrelevant or
excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing, that they are
not kept up to date, or that they are kept for longer than is necessary
unless they are required to be kept for historical, statistical or
scientific purposes.

<span id="para93">93.</span>      It follows from those requirements, laid down in [[!toggle id="art6-93" text="Article 6(1)(c) to (e)"]]
of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], that even initially lawful processing of
accurate data may, in the course of time, become incompatible with the
directive where those data are no longer necessary in the light of the
purposes for which they were collected or processed. That is so in
particular where they appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer
relevant, or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of
the time that has elapsed.

[[!toggleable id="art6-93" text="""
> ‘1.      Member States shall provide that personal data must be:

subject pursuant to [[!toggle id="art12b-94" text="Article 12(b) of Directive"]] [95/46][directive95_46], that the inclusion
in the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of

and containing true information relating to him personally is, at this
point in time, incompatible with [[!toggle id="art12b-94" text="Article 6(1)(c) to (e) of the directive"]]

concerned in the list of results must be erased.

<span id="para96">96.</span>      In the light of the foregoing, when appraising such requests
made in order to oppose processing such as that at issue in the main
proceedings, it should in particular be examined whether the data
subject has a right that the information relating to him personally
should, at this point in time, no longer be linked to his name by a list
of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name.
In this connection, it must be pointed out that it is not necessary in
order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in
question in the list of results causes prejudice to the data subject.

<span id="para97">97.</span>      As the data subject may, in the light of his fundamental rights
under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in
question no longer be made available to the general public by its
inclusion in such a list of results, it should be held, as follows in
particular from [paragraph 81](#para81) of the present judgment, that those rights
override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of
the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding
that information upon a search relating to the data subject’s name.
However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular
reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life,
that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the
preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of
inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question.

<span id="para98">98.</span>      As regards a situation such as that at issue in the main
proceedings, which concerns the display, in the list of results that the
internet user obtains by making a search by means of Google Search on
the basis of the data subject’s name, of links to pages of the on-line
archives of a daily newspaper that contain announcements mentioning the
data subject’s name and relating to a real-estate auction connected with
attachment proceedings for the recovery of social security debts, it
should be held that, having regard to the sensitivity for the data
subject’s private life of the information contained in those
announcements and to the fact that its initial publication had taken
place 16 years earlier, the data subject establishes a right that that
information should no longer be linked to his name by means of such a
list. Accordingly, since in the case in point there do not appear to be
particular reasons substantiating a preponderant interest of the public
in having, in the context of such a search, access to that information,
a matter which is, however, for the referring court to establish, the
data subject may, by virtue of Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the
first paragraph of Article 14 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46], require those links to
be removed from the list of results.

<span id="para99">99.</span>      It follows from the foregoing considerations that the answer to
Question 3 is that Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first
paragraph of Article 14 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] are to be interpreted as
meaning that, when appraising the conditions for the application of
those provisions, it should inter alia be examined whether the data
subject has a right that the information in question relating to him
personally should, at this point in time, no longer be linked to his
name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis
of his name, without it being necessary in order to find such a right
that the inclusion of the information in question in that list causes
prejudice to the data subject. As the data subject may, in the light of
his fundamental rights under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, request
that the information in question no longer be made available to the
general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results,
those rights override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the
operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general
public in having access to that information upon a search relating to
the data subject’s name. However, that would not be the case if it
appeared, for particular reasons, such as the role played by the data
subject in public life, that the interference with his fundamental
rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public
in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to
the information in question.

## Costs

100.    Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main
proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court,
the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in
submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those
parties, are not recoverable.

On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:

1.      **Article 2(b) and (d) of Directive [95/46/EC][directive95_46] of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such data are to be interpreted as meaning that, first,
the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information
published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it
automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available
to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be
classified as ‘processing of personal data’ within the meaning of
Article 2(b) when that information contains personal data and, second,
the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the ‘controller’
in respect of that processing, within the meaning of Article 2(d).**

2.      **Article 4(1)(a) of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] is to be interpreted as
meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context
of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory
of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when the
operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or
subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space
offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the
inhabitants of that Member State.**

3.      **Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of
Article 14 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] are to be interpreted as meaning that, in
order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions and in so
far as the conditions laid down by those provisions are in fact
satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the
list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a
person’s name links to web pages, published by third parties and
containing information relating to that person, also in a case where
that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from
those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in
itself on those pages is lawful.**

4.      **Article 12(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of
Article 14 of Directive [95/46][directive95_46] are to be interpreted as meaning that,
when appraising the conditions for the application of those provisions,
it should inter alia be examined whether the data subject has a right
that the information in question relating to him personally should, at
this point in time, no longer be linked to his name by a list of results
displayed following a search made on the basis of his name, without it
being necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the
information in question in that list causes prejudice to the data
subject. As the data subject may, in the light of his fundamental rights
under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in
question no longer be made available to the general public on account of
its inclusion in such a list of results, those rights override, as a
rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search
engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to
that information upon a search relating to the data subject’s name.
However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular
reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life,
that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the
preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its
inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in
question.**
