This site runs [[ikiwiki]]. It's a mess: it's my blog, it's a wiki, it's stuff
put together. Feel free to explore.

A copy of the source code of this site is available on

<span class="title" id="comment-policy">Comment policy</span>
  
Please keep the comments on-topic. I reserve the right to hide
the content of your comment in my own discretion. Feel free to
send me replies from other corners of the Web, I will happily
link to them.

This website should also support [webmentions] thanks to the [hosted
webmention endpoint]. Have a look at [brid.gy] if you want to send
webmentions from Twitter, Facebook or [other silos].

Also, note that IP addresses of comment posters will be registered and
published through [commit
logs](http://source.hroy-eu.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=summary). If you
do not wish to disclose your IP address through this, then [contact
me](http://hugoroy.eu/index.en.html#email) and Iâ€™ll post the comment for
you.

At last, by commenting, you contribute to the blog and thus your comment is
governed by the [[same_license_as_the_article_to_which_you_comment|copyright]].
