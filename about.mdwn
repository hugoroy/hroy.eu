This site runs [[ikiwiki]]. It's a mess: it's my blog, it's a wiki, it's stuff
put together. Feel free to explore.

A copy of the source code of this site is available on

<span class="title" id="comment-policy">Comment policy</span>

Comments are closed at the moment. Who cares about comments anymore? It seems to me that these days of the web are gone (for good?).
  
<!--Please keep the comments on-topic. I reserve the right to hide
the content of your comment in my own discretion. Feel free to
send me replies from other corners of the Web, I will happily
link to them.-->

This website should also support [webmentions] thanks to the [hosted
webmention endpoint]. Have a look at [brid.gy] if you want to send
webmentions from Twitter, Facebook or [other silos].
