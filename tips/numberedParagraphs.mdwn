Sometimes, you want to get numbered paragraphs throughout a document.

I'm looking for a way to achieve this with [[!taglink pandoc]], in a way that I can
write once, and publish in several formats.


I added this in  pandoc's [[!taglink LaTeX]] template:
    
    $if(numberparagraphs)$
    %% numerate paragraphs with a label
    \newcounter{paranumero}
    \newcommand{\para}[1]{%
    \noindent\refstepcounter{paranumero}\llap{\small\bfseries\theparanumero\label{#1}.~}}
    $endif$


That way, I can write

    \para{shortId} A paragraph...

    and later in the document, I can refer to that paragraph\vref{shortId}

<aside class="sidenote right note">
I was recently told about the [varioref] package, it's awesome.
</aside>

[varioref]: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/varioref

That's good, but it only works in LaTeX. I'd like to write something
similar in a [[!taglink Markdown]] document and be able to also
produce HTML, or even ODT or OOXML.

I'll experiment a bit, but if you have ideas of your own... tell
me :-)

-----------

**TODO**: allow to write `\para` without any value and assign it a
  predictable `\label`... for instance the first letter of the first
  five words of the paragraph.
