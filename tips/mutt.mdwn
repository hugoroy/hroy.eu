[[!tag lang:en mutt]]

I began using [mutt](http://mutt.org) in March 2013. (I was
using Gnome's Evolution before, but its searches were really slow
and one day I really freaked out when Evolution did something
weird which led me to believe that I couldn't see my emails since
2010. It turns out everything was fine, but Evolution hang up on
me).

Beginning on mutt is “not easy.” I went to [mutterwares] to have
experienced user show me how they use it. You might be interested
in some of the [information collected there][mutterwares].
