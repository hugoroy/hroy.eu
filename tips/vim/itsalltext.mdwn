When you get used to a text editor that you like, you start to
get annoyed by all the times you have to enter some text and
you're using a shitty editor. This is so true on the web when you
try to write something in more than 140 characters.

[Matthias](https://fsfe.org/about/kirschner/kirschner.html) showed
me a nice firefox extension: [“it's all
text”](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/its-all-text/)
(you can also install it from debian repos). For each text box,
you just click a small “edit” button and it will fire up vim[^1] and
let you edit the text there, then send it back to the web
interface.

[^1]: Actually, I had to configure it to start GVim instead of
vim. I suppose there's a way to launch a terminal and then vim…
