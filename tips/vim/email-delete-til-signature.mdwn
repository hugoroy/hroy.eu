Reply to an email, easily delete the parts below line
=====================================================

When I reply to emails, Mutt fires up vim. Then
I can quickly navigate until I reach the parts I want to reply to
specifically. Sometimes it’s just a portion of the whole email,
so I want to leave out the rest. [Matthias][mk@fsfe] shared a
nice tip that allowed him to do that quickly.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t working properly for me. I figured out
it’s because in [markdown
mode](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown), I use folding.
By default, my own signature is folded. So I modified the rule a
little bit, and here it goes, just add in your <a
href="https://github.com/hugoroy/.vim/blob/master/vimrc">~/.vimrc</a>:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/hugoroy/6553429.js"></script>
<noscript><pre>
" for email: unfold and delete to your signature
noremap ,dd zi:.;/^-- $/d&lt;CR&gt;O-- &lt;UP&gt;&lt;End&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR
</pre>
<a
href="https://gist.github.com/hugoroy/6553429/raw/0828d0a604398fac8523c3d65907ed635b682b20/email-delete-til-signature.vimrc">most
updated version on github</a>
</noscript>

So when you're below the part you’re replying to, just press
<code>,dd</code> and it will delete the rest of the email between
the line and your signature. 

It only works if your signature is well delimited by <code>--
</code> and if folding is on. If you do not use folding, then use
[the original config provided by
Matthias](https://joindiaspora.com/posts/3167663):

<pre>
noremap ,dd :.;/^-- $/dO-- 
</pre>

[[!meta title="Email: delete until signature"]]
