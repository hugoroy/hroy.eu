Here some little known, yet awesome tools that I use. Thanks to the people working on these (I’m glad to have met most of them, and they’re awesome too)!

#### [[!img feedbin.png size="x28"]] [Feedbin]

[Feedbin] is an RSS web reader. It provides a pleasing reading experience and you can easily browse through items and share links. If you’re looking to host it yourself, have a [look at the sources][fbgh]. 

#### [[!img ikiwiki.png size="x28" title="ikiwiki" alt="ikiwiki"]]

[ikiwiki] powers this blog, hosted by [branchable]. If you like git and markdow, and editing your texts with your favourite text editor, this is for you.

#### [[!img known.png size="x28"]] [Known]

[Known] (formerly “idno”) is more “socially aware” than ikiwiki. It runs with PHP and it’s basically your easy-to-run [indieweb] space. If you use it with <http://brid.gy> you will enjoy a nice integration with twitter and other silos (see [an example of my own](https://ampoliros.net/2014/a-href-classu-in-reply-toaa-hrefneutralite-plateformeshtml-classu-in-reply-toatiens-japprends-par-bortzmeyer-que-le)).

#### [[!img yunohost.png size="x28"]] [YunoHost]

[YunoHost] is custom debian distribution aiming at making self-hosting easy. It provides a nice web interface for administration of your self-hosted server and for users of the web server. If you have basic linux administration skills, this will be very helpful.

#### [[!img pinboard.png size="x28"]] [Pinboard][^nofs]

[Pinboard] a simple and efficient bookmarking app that also archives the content of marked pages (if you pay for it).

#### [[!img sharesome.png size="x28"]] [Sharesome]

[Sharesome] lets you easily share files on the web. It has a pleasant interface that works well on all devices I have tested so far. It’s also available as a [web app][shapp].

The neat feature is that you can choose where to host your data (for instance, with [remotestorage](http://remotestorage.io/); you can get an account at <https://5apps.com>).

#### [[!img tosdr.png size="x28"]] [Terms of Service; Didn’t Read][tosdr]

Some shameless self-promo with [ToSDR], the app that tells you what happens to your rights online by rating and summarising Terms of service and privacy policies. You can also get it [directly in your web browser][tosdrext] or as [a web app][tosdrapp].
